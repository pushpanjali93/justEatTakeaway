The project contains Solution to 2 Automation Cases for JustEatTakeAway as per assignment shared.

To run the project, run: npx cypress open

Test Cases are written in 2 files- FirstTest.cy.js & SecondTest.cy.js and implemented via Custom Commands.

Note-
Some of the code might have Cypress wait(), delay etc which have been used only to provide animation effects for User to observe test cases but the code is written to ensure no waits are needed from Functionality purposes.
